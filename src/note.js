//vue.js have modifiers like .number .trim .lazy

//what .number does is that it converts the input into a number..
//what .trim does is that it removes whitespaces from the begining and end of the input..
//what .lazy does is that it does not updates the variable while still type it only updates it when u click 
//anoda place on the website..

//css styling to keep white space is white-space: pre;

// :value="userData.password"
// @input="userData.password = $event.target.value"
